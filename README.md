# javascript-fetch-api
Hello ...
i created this small web-app to fetch ISS current location into the space using api provided by https://wheretheiss.at/ .
i had fetched latitude and longtitude of ISS from the api and mapped it on the map using leaflet.js library.
I used Bootswatch theme for this project.
